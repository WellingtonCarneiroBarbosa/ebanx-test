## Installation

You should have Docker installed and running on your system.

```sh
sudo sh docker_setup.sh && ./vendor/bin/sail up
```

## Usage example

To set up the containers, we are using Laravel Sail. Simply run ```./vendor/bin/sail up```, and everything will be okay.
The container will set up a server accessible at http://localhost:80.

## Testing

The application has automated tests. To test if everything is working correctly, simply run the following command:
